# URL Shortner 

A simple URL shortener web application that allows users to generate shortened URLs and specify a custom expiry time (in hours, minutes, and seconds), after which the link becomes inactive. It includes a user-friendly interface and handles automatic deletion of expired URLs.

---

## Features

- Shorten any valid URL to a short, unique code.
- Users can set expiry time (hours, minutes, seconds) for each shortened URL.
- Redirect users to the original URL if the short URL is still valid.
- Show a **not found page** if the URL has expired or does not exist.
- **Implemented SOLID design principles** for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (functional components with Hooks), React Router DOM for routing, CSS Modules for styling, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend:** Django, Gunicorn, WhiteNoise (for serving static files)
- **Database:** SQLite 
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Terraform

## API Endpoints

### 1. POST `/shorten`
Creates a shortened URL with a specified expiration time (hours, minutes, seconds). Requires a JSON body containing the original URL and expiration details. Returns the generated short URL if successful.

---

### 2. GET `/<short_code>/`
Redirects to the original URL corresponding to the provided short code. If the link has expired or does not exist, it redirects to the `/expired` route.

---

### 3. GET `/*`
Catch-all route to serve the React frontendâ€™s `index.html` file for any undefined paths. This supports frontend routing in single-page applications. Returns a 404 if the frontend build file is missing.
